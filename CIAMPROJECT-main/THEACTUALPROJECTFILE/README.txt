Hey there! those are the draft files for the website!
It's very chaotic (they have been organised by me)
and we were a bit disorganised considering where we were going to put our ressoucres. But well , al khayr fima ikhtaraho lah
Actually you'll noticed that the front page is a mess of JS HTML and CSS not only static
as for the studying pages , it's just boring HTML AND CSS. It's static!
that's all I got to say. Take care and enjoy yourself!
